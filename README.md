##  Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture**:

- **State Management:** Cubit (`flutter_bloc`)
- **Layer Separation:**  
  - `data/`: data sources, models, repositories  
  - `domain/`: base repositories, use cases  
  - `presentation/`: cubits, components, screens

- **Dependency Injection:** Managed with `get_it` for service locator pattern.
- **Network Requests:** Handled using `dio` for efficient API calls and also `http` for simpler requests.
- **Local Storage:** Utilizes `shared_preferences` for theme and bool for onboarding state.
